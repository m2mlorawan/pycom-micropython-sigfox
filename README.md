The MicroPython project
=======================
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycom/LoPy/master/images/LopySide.jpg" alt="The LoPy"/>
</p>

This is the MicroPython project, which aims to put an implementation
of Python 3.x on microcontrollers and small embedded systems.
You can find the official website at [micropython.org](http://www.micropython.org).

WARNING: this project is in beta stage and is subject to changes of the
code-base, including project-wide name changes and API changes.

MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including exceptions,
"with", "yield from", etc., and additionally "async" keyword from Python 3.5).
The following core datatypes are provided: str (including basic Unicode
support), bytes, bytearray, tuple, list, dict, set, frozenset, array.array,
collections.namedtuple, classes and instances. Builtin modules include sys,
time, and struct, etc. Select ports have support for _thread module
(multithreading). Note that only subset of Python 3.4 functionality
implemented for the data types and modules.

See the repository www.github.com/micropython/pyboard for the MicroPython
board (PyBoard), the officially supported reference electronic circuit board.

Major components in this repository:
- py/ -- the core Python implementation, including compiler, runtime, and
  core library.
- unix/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on Unix.
- exp32/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the ESP32 based boards from Pycom.
- stmhal/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the PyBoard and similar
  STM32 boards (using ST's Cube HAL drivers).
- minimal/ -- a minimal MicroPython port. Start with this if you want
  to port MicroPython to another microcontroller.
- tests/ -- test framework and test scripts.
- docs/ -- user documentation in Sphinx reStructuredText format.

Additional components:
- bare-arm/ -- a bare minimum version of MicroPython for ARM MCUs. Used
  mostly to control code size.
- teensy/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the Teensy 3.1
  (preliminary but functional).
- pic16bit/ -- a version of MicroPython for 16-bit PIC microcontrollers.
- cc3200/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the CC3200 from TI.
- esp8266/ -- an experimental port for ESP8266 WiFi modules.
- tools/ -- various tools, including the pyboard.py module.
- examples/ -- a few example Python scripts.

The subdirectories above may include READMEs with additional info.

"make" is used to build the components, or "gmake" on BSD-based systems.
You will also need bash and Python (at least 2.7 or 3.3).

The Unix version
----------------

The "unix" port requires a standard Unix environment with gcc and GNU make.
x86 and x64 architectures are supported (i.e. x86 32- and 64-bit), as well
as ARM and MIPS. Making full-featured port to another architecture requires
writing some assembly code for the exception handling and garbage collection.
Alternatively, fallback implementation based on setjmp/longjmp can be used.

To build (see section below for required dependencies):

    $ cd unix
    $ make axtls
    $ make

Then to give it a try:

    $ ./micropython
    >>> list(5 * x + y for x in range(10) for y in [4, 2, 1])

Use `CTRL-D` (i.e. EOF) to exit the shell.
Learn about command-line options (in particular, how to increase heap size
which may be needed for larger applications):

    $ ./micropython --help

Run complete testsuite:

    $ make test

Unix version comes with a builtin package manager called upip, e.g.:

    $ ./micropython -m upip install micropython-pystone
    $ ./micropython -m pystone

Browse available modules on
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=micropython).
Standard library modules come from
[micropython-lib](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib) project.

External dependencies
---------------------

Building Unix version requires some dependencies installed. For
Debian/Ubuntu/Mint derivative Linux distros, install `build-essential`
(includes toolchain and make), `libffi-dev`, and `pkg-config` packages.

Other dependencies can be built together with MicroPython. Oftentimes,
you need to do this to enable extra features or capabilities. To build
these additional dependencies, first fetch git submodules for them:

    $ git submodule update --init

Use this same command to get the latest versions of dependencies, as
they are updated from time to time. After that, in `unix/` dir, execute:

    $ make deplibs

This will build all available dependencies (regardless whether they
are used or not). If you intend to build MicroPython with additional
options (like cross-compiling), the same set of options should be passed
to `make deplibs`. To actually enabled use of dependencies, edit
`unix/mpconfigport.mk` file, which has inline descriptions of the options.
For example, to build SSL module (required for `upip` tool described above),
set `MICROPY_PY_USSL` to 1.

In `unix/mpconfigport.mk`, you can also disable some dependencies enabled
by default, like FFI support, which requires libffi development files to
be installed.

The ESP32 version
-----------------

The "esp32" port requires an xtensa gcc compiler, which can be downloaded from
the Espressif website:

- for 64-bit Linux::

    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-59.tar.gz

- for 32-bit Linux::

    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux32-1.22.0-59.tar.gz

- for Mac OS:

    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-osx-1.22.0-59.tar.gz

To use it, you will need to update your ``PATH`` environment variable in ``~/.bash_profile`` file. To make ``xtensa-esp32-elf`` available for all terminal sessions, add the following line to your ``~/.bash_profile`` file::

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin

Alternatively, you may create an alias for the above command. This way you can get the toolchain only when you need it. To do this, add different line to your ``~/.bash_profile`` file::

    alias get_esp32="export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"

Then when you need the toolchain you can type ``get_esp32`` on the command line and the toolchain will be added to your ``PATH``.

You also need the ESP IDF along side this repository in order to build the ESP32 port.
To get it:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pycom/pycom-esp-idf.git

After cloning, make sure to checkout all the submodules:

    $ cd pycom-esp-idf
    $ git submodule update --init

Finally, before building, export the IDF_PATH variable

    $ export IDF_PATH=~/pycom-esp-idf

To build and flash your LoPy for 868MHz regions:

    $ cd esp32
    $ make BOARD=LOPY TARGET=boot
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_868 TARGET=app
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_868 flash

or for 915MHz regions:

    $ cd esp32
    $ make BOARD=LOPY TARGET=boot
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_915 TARGET=app
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_915 flash

or the WiPy 2.0:

    $ cd esp32
    $ make BOARD=WIPY TARGET=boot
    $ make BOARD=WIPY TARGET=app
    $ make BOARD=WIPY flash

Make sure that your board is placed into programming mode, otherwise flahing will fail.
To do this, connect ``P2`` to ``GND`` and then reset the board.

For more recent information about the process of building and flashing, please refer to
the `README.md` file in the `esp32` folder.
