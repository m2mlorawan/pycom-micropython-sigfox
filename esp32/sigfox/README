This directory contains the sigfox support.

There are three prebuilt libraries for SIPY, LOPY4, and FIPY.

@Pycom In order to build these libraries execute the following steps using the private pyupython repository:

git clone -b sigfox git@github.com:pycom/pyupython.git src
cd src
git checkout 9a5e7a9b
cd ../..
make BOARD=LOPY4 TARGET=sigfox
make BOARD=FIPY TARGET=sigfox
make BOARD=SIPY TARGET=sigfox
./get_sigfox_libs.py

Now you see the updated .a files with

git status sigfox

which can be PR-ed in parallel with any sigfox code changes.

If you update the sigfox code, be sure to:

a) PR your sigfox changes to pyupython
b) PR the .a files to Firmware-Development and
c) update the git hash further up in this README file, so it is clear from which commit the libraries were built
